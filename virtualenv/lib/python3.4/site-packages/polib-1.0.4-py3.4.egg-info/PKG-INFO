        b"=====\npolib\n=====\n\npolib is a library to manipulate, create, modify gettext files (pot, po and mo\nfiles). You can load existing files, iterate through it's entries, add, modify\nentries, comments or metadata, etc... or create new po files from scratch.\n\npolib supports out of the box any version of python ranging from 2.4 to latest\n3.X version.\n\npolib is pretty stable now and is used by many \n`opensource projects <http://polib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/projects.html>`_.\n\nThe project code and bugtracker is hosted on \n`Bitbucket <http://bitbucket.org/izi/polib/>`_. \n\npolib is generously documented, you can `browse the documentation online \n<http://polib.readthedocs.org/>`_, a good start is to read \n`the quickstart guide  <http://polib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html>`_.\n\nThanks for downloading polib !\n"
        
        b'=========\nChangelog\n=========\n\nVersion 1.0.4 (2014/02/19)\n--------------------------\n - Fixed issue #43: improved check that determine if polib is dealing with a filepath or unicode content\n - Fixed issue #44: polib now checks MO files revision number and throws an error if the number is unexpected\n - Fixed issue #45: parse properly mo files with no header entry\n - Fixed issue #47: added flags attribute for MOEntry to be consistant with POEntry\n - Fixed issue #49: use integers rather than strings for msgstr_plural keys\n - Fixed issue #51: if a PO file ends with a comment, polib adds a spurious empty entry at the end\n - Fixed issue #52: bad magic number written on big endian platforms\n - Fixed issue #53: added a __hash__() method to POEntry and MOEntry classes\n - Fixed issue #54: use lowercase for state identifiers. This fixes issues with certain locales and string.lower()\n - Fixed issue #58: use io.open() instead of codecs.open() because the latter doesn\'t handle very well universal line endings\n - Make sure the mo file is closed at garbage collection, this prevents warnings on unclosed file when running tests with python >= 3.2\n - Better way to test indianness\n - polib download URL is now on Pypi\n\nVersion 1.0.3 (2013/02/09)\n--------------------------\n - Fixed issue #38: POFile.append() raised a duplicate exception when you tried to add a new entry with the same msgid and a different msgctxt (only when check_for_duplicates option is set to True)\n -
